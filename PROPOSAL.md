## Elevator Pitch

With the current state of the world, people are spending more time than ever in their own homes. For many of us (especially those of us with high-energy children), all that extra time cooped up inside often means increased stress, anxiety, and/or just plain boredom. Whatever of these symptoms you might be experiencing, we know of one solution to aid with them all - alcohol! We would love to welcome you to The Cocktail Lounge - your online solution for finding the tastiest and/or “most efficient” way to take the edge off… or just make your forget that you’re stuck at home altogether.
Easily find recipes by name, or even just filter them out by ingredient if you know what you’ve got in your house, but aren’t so sure what you can make out of it. Feeling adventurous? We’ve got a “Just \*\*\*\* Me Up Fam” button that will find you a random recipe. The possibilities are only limited by what you’ve got in your liquor cabinet.
“Premium” users also unlock the ability to save & share their favorite recipes with other members of The Cocktail Lounge - you can even create and share your favorite “experiments” that we’re sure you’ve been fiddling with since this whole “stay at home” business started. Compete with your friends to see who can get the most 5-Star ratings on their custom cocktails - endless fun and creativity await!
